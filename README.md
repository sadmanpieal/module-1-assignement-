## Topic:  Version Control using Git and GitHub: Commit, Branching, Merging, and Pull Requests

## Steps:

## Set Up a Local Git Repository:

Initialize a new Git repository in your local development environment.

Create a new text file named README.md and add some initial project description or any content you choose.

Stage and commit this file with an appropriate commit message.

 

## Create a New GitHub Repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub with a meaningful name.

Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository (using git remote add).

Push your local commits to the GitHub repository.

 

## Branching:

Create a new branch in your local repository called “dev”.

Switch to your new branch and create a new file called  hello.txt.

Commit the changes to your new branch.

 

## Pushing the New Branch:

Push your new branch to GitHub, making sure it's reflected in your remote repository.

Verify that your new branch is visible on GitHub.

 

## Create a Pull Request:

Once the new changes have been committed and pushed, go to your GitHub repository.

Open a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.

Provide a description of the changes you made in the pull request.

 

## Merge the Pull Request:

After reviewing your pull request, merge the pull request into the main branch on GitHub.

Ensure that your local main branch is updated after the merge.

 

## Submission Instructions:

Once you have completed the above steps, ensure your GitHub repository is public.

Share the link to your public GitHub repository where all the changes and pull requests can be viewed.
